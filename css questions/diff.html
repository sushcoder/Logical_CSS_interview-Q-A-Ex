QUESTION:DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INPUT TYPE="BUTTON" AND INPUT TYPE="SUBMIT"?


<input type="button" /> buttons will not submit a form - they don't do anything by default. They're generally used in conjunction with JavaScript as part of an AJAX application.

<input type="submit"> buttons will submit the form they are in when the user clicks on them, unless you specify otherwise with JavaScript.
